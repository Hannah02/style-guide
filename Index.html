      <h1 id="Intro2">And this is some sample text so stop reading it now, please. Pieces of illustration that are heavily stylised really stand out to me as I feel that they have a strong visual pull and their visual connection to a certain time period can really juxtapose the subject matter, for example the conservative mentality and impressive work ethic of the 1950â€²s with the increasingly liberal thinking and convenience of the contemporary generation due to technology. <br> <br></h1>

      <h3><br>But if theres a lot of text needed in a small space, for example if the screen is split for an image, this size font should be used to accommodate that. The rest of this text is just a placeholder. Sketching is and always has been very important to me, not only in how I generate new ideas for projects I work on but also in my life in general as I really enjoy drawing and I find it a fun and a great way to be creative with no restrictions.I wanted to draw random characters, shapes and designs for the first part of my website as I felt that it really summed up the personal interest and love for the craft of designing and illustrating that I have. I felt that a portfolio website would be a lot less effective if it didnt distinctly communicate who I am, as I feel that I am quite confident about who I am as a designer at this moment. I also recognise that as a designer I will be able to discover new things and grow creatively over the next few years. I feel that I can very easily change my website to accommodate this by adding in and swapping out vector drawings as I develop which makes my website and also my overall brand quite flexible.</h3>
